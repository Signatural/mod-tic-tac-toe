			<h2>Rules Of The Game</br></h2>
			</br>
			<h3>
			<ol>
			<li>The game space is a 4x4 grid Board.</li></br><li>The game is played by two players at the same time, each one will choose to play with a colour, either Blue or Green.</li></br><li>Blue always goes first.</li></br>
			<li>Players alternate by clicking/touching the selected spaces on the board until either </br>(a) one player has four in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally; or</br>(b) there are no possible moves for any of the players to have four in a row.If a player is able to draw four Blue blocks or four Green Blocks in a row, that player wins.</li></br><li>If all 16 squares are filled or if before getting to that number neither player can win, the game is a draw.</li></br><li>Every so often a player gets the opportunity of placing "bonus moves" to block his opponent with dark grey blocks. Nevertheless, be careful placing these bocks since they will block the space for you too!</li></h3>
